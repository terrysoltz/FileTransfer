# FileTransfer
A file updating user interface implemented using Python and the tkinter library. This tool allows a user to navigate through the directory tree of their computer to find .txt files that have been modified since the last time files were logged using this utility, then save these files to another selected directory. It demonstrates the use of tkinter nested frames, listboxes, treeviews, and scrollbars, parameter passing between objects, and various python file management tools.
